#CounterMap 

The number of SMP is 11 ,instead of 10 in Run78 because SKS-TOF was added.
The CounterMap should be modified from the original one (Number of SMP 10 -> 11), otherwise analysis codes will be crashed.

In the original Countermap from K1.8BR DAQ-PC, channel ordering of Crate1 slot 9 and 16 was inverted.
