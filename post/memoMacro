How to decompose K0/Sigma+/Sigma- overlap region

1. Fit K0 distribution in IM(npi-) vs IM(npi+) space
Decompose Sigma+/Sigma- as well
Fit2DK0.C
output file: fout_qlo.root and fout_qhi.root

2. Estimate Sigma+/Sigma- decoposition error 
(maybe replaced in the future)
SpSmDecoError.C
output file:

DecomposK0SpSm.C
